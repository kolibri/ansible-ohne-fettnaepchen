# The Problem.

## What we want

---

- We need more/less webservers/containers/ec2instances/etc, (scaling)
- We have to setup ssl/upgrade php/remove ssh access for the po/etc. on some of/all our servers (maintenance)
- We want to know, what is installed/configured on our machines (documentation)
- We want to approve every change the trainee makes on our machines (reviewability)
- We need to discuss the setup or our infrastructure (teamwork and knowledge sharing)
- We need development vm's for our developers (singe point of truth)
- And we want it, when we need it (automation)

# Quick tool overview


- [Chef](https://www.chef.io/)
- [Puppet](https://puppet.com/)
- [SaltStack](https://www.saltstack.com/)
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) (this is, what this talk is about)

---

# About Ansible

- Open source (GPL) and available on [github](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)
- Maintained and owned by Redhat
- written in python
- configured with YAML files (sorry [Marco](https://twitter.com/Ocramius) ;)

# How to install ansible

- Via yor favourite/available package manager

`(pacman -S)/(apt-get/brew/yum/pip install) ansible`

---

export default Pitfall

There are a lot of installation methods mentioned on the installation guide.

Just take the most easiest for you.

Do not install ansible via Git, unless you know, what you are doing

---

# How does ansible work

---

# The usual setup

- One control machine
- Some managed machines

---

# The control machine

The only machine we interact with directly is the control machine.
It has ansible installed and our self written scripts checked out.

---

# The managed machines

We do not log in onto this machines manualy (in a perfect world, we would not have access to this machines)
The only need python (=> 2.7) or Python 3 (>= 3.5) installed
And, our control machine has to be able to connect to the managed machines.

# Assistested quickstart with Vagrant


---

```ruby
# ./Vagrantfile
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.vm.box = "debian/stretch64"
    config.vm.host_name = "ansible-quickstart.foo"
    config.vm.provision "ansible_local" do |ansible|
        ansible.playbook = "site.yml"
        ansible.verbose = true
    end
end

```yaml
# ./site.yml
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Greet someone
      shell: echo 'Hello World'
```

---

```bash
# starting the box (provisioning is only executed when the box is created)
$ vagrant up
# run the provisioning manually
$ vagrant provision
```

# First concepts of Ansible

---

## Playbooks


YAML-files, that are executed by the `ansible-playbook` command.

Assigns tasks (and/or roles) to a hosts, where they should be applied.

---


## Tasks

Single step during the playbook run.

They represent the concrete use of a module.

---

### Task examples

- Ensure that file `$xxy` exists with this content (`template`, `copy`)
- Ensure service `$abc` is running (`service`)
- Ensure user `foobar` exists and has no sudo privilege (`user`)
- Deploy `$app` to prod (`deploy_helper`)
- Run script `take_world_leadership.sh` (`shell`, `command`)
- Ensure this git repo is checked out and at the current commit of that branch (`git`)

---

export default Pitfall

Always name your tasks!  
Name them unique and meaningfull.


This allows you to use the  `--start-at-task` option of `ansible-playbook`


---

export default Tip

Call ansible at least with the first verbosity level (`ansible-playbook -v`).

This will show you details about the executed tasks, that may have useful informations.

---


# Writing our first tasks

Install git and place a config file for the user

---


```ini
#  ./gitconfig.dist
[user]
    email = tamara.tester@testingen.foo
    name = Tamara Tester
[core]
    excludesfile = /home/vagrant/.gitignore
    editor = vi
```

---

```yaml
# ./site.yml 
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: ensure git is installed
      become: true
      package:
        name: git
        state: present
    - name: ensure git configs
      copy:
        src: gitconfig.dist
        dest: /home/vagrant/.gitconfig
```
