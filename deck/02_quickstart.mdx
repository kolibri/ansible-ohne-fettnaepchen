# First concepts of Ansible

---

## Playbooks


YAML-files, that are executed by the `ansible-playbook` command.

Assigns tasks (and/or roles) to a hosts, where they should be applied.

---


## Tasks

Single step during the playbook run.

They represent the concrete use of a module.

---

### Task examples

- Ensure that file `$xxy` exists with this content (`template`, `copy`)
- Ensure service `$abc` is running (`service`)
- Ensure user `foobar` exists and has no sudo privilege (`user`)
- Deploy `$app` to prod (`deploy_helper`)
- Run script `take_world_leadership.sh` (`shell`, `command`)
- Ensure this git repo is checked out and at the current commit of that branch (`git`)

---

<Pitfall>

Always name your tasks!  
Name them unique and meaningfull.


This allows you to use the  `--start-at-task` option of `ansible-playbook`

</Pitfall>

---

<Tip>


Call ansible at least with the first verbosity level (`ansible-playbook -v`).

This will show you details about the executed tasks, that may have useful informations.

# Writing our first Playbook

Install git and place a config file for the user

---

<CodeSurferLayout>

```ini
# ./gitconfig.dist
[user]
    email = tamara.tester@testingen.foo
    name = Tamara Tester
[core]
    excludesfile = /home/vagrant/.gitignore
    editor = vi
```

</CodeSurferLayout>

---

<CodeSurferLayout>

```yaml
# ./playbook.yml 
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: "ensure git is installed"
      become: true
      package:
        name: git
        state: present
    - name: ensure git configs
      copy:
        src: gitconfig.dist
        dest: /home/vagrant/.gitconfig

# Understanding `become`

---

`become` is the mechanism to run tasks as another user than the current.

In short words, you could say "when I use `sudo` on the shell, I use `become` in ansible"

---

<CodeSurferLayout>

```yaml title="become default configuration"
become: false
become_user: root 
become_method: sudo 
become_flags: ~
```


```diff 1 subtitle="activates privilege escalation"
```

```diff 2 subtitle="specify user to become"
```

```diff 3 subtitle="define method to become user"
```

```diff 4 subtitle="add extra flags"
```

</CodeSurferLayout>

---

<Pitfall>

Setting `become_user`, `become_method` or `become_flags` does NOT imply `become: true`.

This means, you can configure `become_user/method/flags` globally or for a group of tasks and still enable become only for when you need it.

</Pitfall>

---

<Pitfall>

Ansible does not create a new connection to become another user.
The user you use for connecting to the remote must be able to perform the `become`.

Imagine, you ssh into the machine and then call a command with `sudo`.
This is the same for ansible.

</Pitfall>

---

<Tip>

`become` can do more than gaining admin priviliges.
You can use it, to perform tasks as another user on your system.
Keep this in mind, when you have to deal with multiple user accounts.

```

</CodeSurferLayout>

---

<Pitfall>

We have to write valid YAML files.

This means, we have to surround Jinja2 statements with quotation marks:

`dest: {{ my_fact }}/foo` will cause an error.

`dest: "{{ my_fact }}/foo"`  will do the job.

</Pitfall>

---

<CodeSurferLayout>

```yaml title="Facts are global per run"
- hosts: all
  vars:
    my_var: foobar
  tasks:
    - debug: var=my_var

- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - debug: var=my_var
```

```diff 1:5 title="Facts are global per run" subtitle='{ "my_var": "foobar" }'

```diff 6:9 title="Facts are global per run" subtitle='{ "my_var": "VARIABLE IS NOT DEFINED!" }'

# Templates

---

<CodeSurferLayout>

```yaml
# site.yml
- hosts: all
  vars:
    git_user_email: tamara@tester.de
    git_user_name: tamara Tester
  tasks:
    - name: ensure git configs
      template:
        src: gitconfig.j2
        dest: "{{ ansible_user_dir }}/.gitconfig"
```

```diff 3:5 subtitle="define variable inside playbook"
```

```diff 7:10 subtitle="ensure parsed template on remote"
```

</CodeSurferLayout>

---

<CodeSurferLayout>

```ini
# gitconfig.j2
[user]
    email = {{ git_user_email }}
    name = {{ git_user_name }}
[core]
    excludesfile = {{ ansible_user_dir }}/.gitignore
    editor = nano
```

```diff 3[13:33],4[12:32] subtitle="variable from playbook"
```

```diff 6[20:41] subtitle="variable from facts"
```

</CodeSurferLayout>

---

<Tip>

Always add the `.j2` file extension to your templates.

Also add the ending fo the target file format, if there is one.

Example: `vhost.conf.j2`. With this, you can easily spot, that this file is a template and the rendered result will be a `*.conf` file.

</Tip>

# Loops

# Extending our first Playbook

Install zsh and place some aliases

<Tip>

Handlers are just tasks. You can use the same modules here.

</Tip>

---

<Pitfall>

Do not start or restart your services at task level. Just enable them with the `service` module and add a notify to the restarting handler.

</Pitfall>

---

<Pitfall>

Handlers are only executed, when at least one of the notifying tasks get the `changed` state during the playbook run.

</Pitfall>
